ICE is an app designed to help people in emergency with only few clicks.

Users are able to seek for help by text, emails, facebook, twitter with only 2 clicks. The message sent include the user's current location, a short voice message(emails only,optional,mp3 format) and a pre-set message that the user is in a emergency situation. 

When in any kinds of emergency, user only needs to click the app(which has a big red circle icon), and click whatever methods they want to choose and click post/send. It only takes 2-3 seconds to make it work! The app also comes with a flash light controller which can control the flash light to light on/off or flash in a certain frequency(1-10hz). The Chinese localization is included(The app switches to Chinese when the system does).
